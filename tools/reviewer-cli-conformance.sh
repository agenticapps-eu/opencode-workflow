# reviewer-cli-conformance.sh — scores a reviewer-cli.sh implementation against
# the contract in reference-implementations/reviewer-cli/README.md.
#
# §18 requires the change-gate be "demonstrable by direct script invocation with
# simulated payloads". The wrapper the gate's review *producer* depends on
# deserves the same bar: a reviewer-cli that silently lost a vendor arm degrades
# the evidence §18 exists to compel, and reports nothing while doing it.
#
# Usage: tools/reviewer-cli-conformance.sh <path-to-reviewer-cli> [...]
#        tools/reviewer-cli-conformance.sh --family    # score every host copy
#
# Exit 0 = every scored copy conforms, 1 = at least one row failed.
# Read-only with respect to the repo and the host clones: every vendor CLI is
# stubbed on PATH in a mktemp dir removed on exit. No real reviewer is invoked.
#
# Sections:
#   A. Argument handling — usage and lookup errors must be exit 3, never a
#      partial run.
#   B. Vendor arms — every vendor in the canonical set must be dispatchable.
#      This is the section that would have caught core#41: a copy missing the
#      `opencode` arm fails here and nowhere else.
#   C. Hardening — the two properties this wrapper exists for. Both are scored
#      per-arm, because the pre-1.0.0 copies pinned stdin at each call site and
#      an arm added later could miss the redirect invisibly.
#   D. Timeout contract — REVIEWER_TIMEOUT honoured, 124 mapped to a die.
