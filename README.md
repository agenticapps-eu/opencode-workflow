# opencode-workflow

opencode port of the AgenticApps spec-first workflow.

This repo is the opencode peer of [`claude-workflow`](https://github.com/agenticapps-eu/claude-workflow)
and [`pi-agentic-apps-workflow`](https://github.com/agenticapps-eu/pi-agentic-apps-workflow).
It implements the canonical contract defined in
[`agenticapps-workflow-core`](https://github.com/agenticapps-eu/agenticapps-workflow-core)
as native opencode skills.

> **Forked from [`codex-workflow`](https://github.com/agenticapps-eu/codex-workflow).**
> New clone? Read **[`SETUP-REMOTE.md`](SETUP-REMOTE.md)** for git/remote
> init and pointing opencode at GLM 5.2. The binding layer and the
> snapshot-install divergence are documented in
> [`docs/LINEAGE.md`](docs/LINEAGE.md) and
> [`docs/decisions/0007-snapshot-install.md`](docs/decisions/0007-snapshot-install.md).
> **Fresh installs no longer replay the migration chain** — they lay
> down the latest snapshot directly; migrations are for upgrades only.

## Status

**v0.2.1 / `agenticapps-workflow-core` spec 0.4.0 — shipped.** Builds on
v0.1.0 (full conformance to spec 0.1.0) by absorbing the 0.2.0→0.4.0 spec
deltas: **§11 Coding Discipline** (canonical prose in `AGENTS.md`), **§13
declare-first TypeScript** (`opencode-ts-declare-first`), **§12 authoring
conventions** (surgical Mermaid), and **§10 observability** (delegated to
the standalone `agenticapps-observability` skill). The trigger skill, 14
gate skills, 5 GSD entry-point skills, 2 lifecycle skills, migration
chain (`0000`–`0004`), templates, and `install.sh` cite
`implements_spec: 0.4.0`. (v0.2.1 patches a §11 mirror byte-drift vs
current core — see CHANGELOG.) The scaffolder self-applies its own workflow.

See `docs/decisions/` for architecture decisions, `docs/ENFORCEMENT-PLAN.md`
for the gate-to-skill bindings on this scaffolder's own development,
and `CHANGELOG.md` for the artifact inventory at each tag.

## What ships at v0.2.0 (spec 0.4.0)

- **Trigger skill** (`agentic-apps-workflow`) — activates on any code
  task, emits the canonical commitment ritual, routes to the right
  gate skills; reproduces the **five** canonical-prose blocks verbatim
  (incl. §11 Coding Discipline in `AGENTS.md`)
- **14 gate skills** (`opencode-*`) — native opencode implementations of
  TDD, **declare-first TypeScript (`opencode-ts-declare-first`, §13)**,
  verification, two-stage review, brainstorming,
  design-shotgun, design-critique, CSO security, QA (with both
  per-task ui-preview and post-phase qa modes), impeccable-audit,
  database-sentinel-audit, systematic-debugging, finishing-branch
- **§10 observability** — delegated to `agenticapps-observability`
  (installed on opencode via its `install-codex.sh`); wired by migration
  `0003`. See `docs/observability-delegation.md`
- **5 GSD entry-point skills** (`gsd-*`) — explicit-only
  (`policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false`); see
  `docs/decisions/0003-gsd-entry-points-as-prompts.md` for why these
  are skills, not a separate `prompts/` surface
- **2 lifecycle skills** (`setup-opencode-agenticapps-workflow`,
  `update-opencode-agenticapps-workflow`) — bootstrap and migrate a
  project's AGENTS.md / `.planning/` / `.opencode/` configuration
- **Migration framework** — implements
  `agenticapps-workflow-core/spec/08-migration-format.md`; ships
  `0000-baseline.md` … `0004-revendor-spec-11.md` (contiguous
  chain), fixture-based test harness with a drift test, atomicity +
  idempotency contracts
- **Templates** (under `skills/setup-opencode-agenticapps-workflow/templates/`)
  — `agents-md-additions.md`, `workflow-config.md`, `config-hooks.json`,
  `adr-db-security-acceptance.md`, `global-agents-additions.md`,
  `spec-mirrors/`
- **`install.sh`** — symlinks the skills into `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/`
  (templates ship inside the setup skill — no secondary symlink);
  refreshes the `agenticapps-shared` submodule; idempotent; repoints stale/
  dangling links; `--copy` and `--dry-run` flags

Every shipped artifact cites `implements_spec: 0.4.0` so conformance
is auditable.

## Consumes

- [`agenticapps-shared`](https://github.com/agenticapps-eu/agenticapps-shared)
  as a git submodule at `vendor/agenticapps-shared/` — the shared migration
  test-harness primitives (helpers, fixture-runner, drift-test). SPLIT-01
  parity with claude-workflow + agenticapps-observability.
- [`agenticapps-observability`](https://github.com/agenticapps-eu/agenticapps-observability)
  — the §10 observability generator, consumed by delegation (see
  `docs/observability-delegation.md`).

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agenticapps-eu/opencode-workflow ~/Sourcecode/opencode-workflow
cd ~/Sourcecode/opencode-workflow
bash install.sh
# Restart opencode (or open a fresh session) to pick up the new skills.
```

Then in a fresh project: `$setup-opencode-agenticapps-workflow`. In an
existing installed project, `$update-opencode-agenticapps-workflow`.
