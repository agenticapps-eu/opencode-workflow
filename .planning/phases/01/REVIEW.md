# Phase 1 — REVIEW (two-stage)

## Stage 1 — Spec compliance (opencode-spec-review, inline)

Checked the §11 absorption against core `spec/11-coding-discipline.md` and
`spec/09-conformance.md`:

- §09 item 1 (canonical-prose verbatim): mirror + AGENTS.md block diff-clean
  against core lines 27–101. ✓
- §09 "the block, including its heading": block starts at
  `## Coding Discipline (NON-NEGOTIABLE)`. ✓
- §11 SHOULD (near the top): injected as the first managed section, before
  `## Development Workflow`. ✓
- §11 MUST reconcile (heading present without provenance): migration 0001
  pre-flight hard-aborts with two hand-resolution paths. ✓
- Version coupling (hand-off hard constraint): version + implements_spec move
  together in 0001 Step 2 (both-or-abort). ✓

Verdict: PASS.

## Stage 2 — Independent code-quality review (opencode-code-review)

An independent reviewer (separate context) reviewed `main...HEAD`, re-running
the harness, diffing bytes, and exercising the awk/sed on synthetic fixtures
under BSD/macOS tooling.

- §11 byte-identity: CORRECT (3744 bytes; `§`/`—` intact; trailing newline OK).
- Migration 0001: CORRECT (awk inject + EOF fallback; conflict regex; coupled,
  idempotent, macOS-portable sed; `.bak` cleaned).
- Drift test: CORRECT (filename-sort latest; stays green when 0002/0003 land
  with to_version 0.2.0).
- run-tests.sh: CORRECT (mktemp/trap RETURN; assert_check contract; no
  false-pass paths; 20 PASS / 1 SKIP / 0 FAIL).
- Migration format + chain contiguity + workflow-version.txt deferral: CORRECT.
- ADR-0004 / CONTEXT.md: factually accurate against cited sources.

**Verdict: APPROVE** — no BLOCK/HIGH items.

### NITs (no action required)

- Conflict pre-flight greps the whole file for the provenance anchor rather
  than asserting adjacency to the offending heading. Only a pathological
  hand-edited AGENTS.md (unmanaged §11 heading + a stray provenance comment
  elsewhere) would slip past — not realistic for a managed file. Left as-is;
  tightening would complicate the idempotency check for no real-world gain.
- ADR-0004 cites §10 spec version "current 0.3.2" (the spec file's
  `spec_version`); the obs *product* is at 0.11.x. Both labels are correct in
  their own axis; left as-is.
