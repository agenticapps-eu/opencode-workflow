# Phase 4 — REVIEW (two-stage)

Reviewed jointly with Phase 2 (commits `8f24662` + `21f3aab`) — see
`.planning/phases/02/REVIEW.md` for the full Stage-2 report.

## Stage 1 — Spec compliance (opencode-spec-review, inline)

§12: branchy workflow rendered as a Mermaid `flowchart` (decision skeleton)
with criteria kept in prose/tables; surgical scope honored (only edited
skills converted; gsd-execute-phase left unconverted — bulk conversion not
required). Verdict: PASS.

## Stage 2 — Independent code-quality review (opencode-code-review)

- Both flowcharts (trigger Step 2 routing + §13 refusals) **parse as valid**
  under the official mermaid parser.
- Step 2 diagram has the labeled dotted fallback edge
  (`-.->|ambiguous: ... pick the HIGHER size|`), the `exec ↔ gates` cycle,
  and a `report[REPORT: ...]` terminal.
- **0 deletion lines** to the trigger skill — additions only; Step 1/Step 2
  criteria tables intact; diagram and tables agree (no elided branch).

**Verdict: APPROVE** — no BLOCK/HIGH.
