# Phase 2 — REVIEW (two-stage)

## Stage 1 — Spec compliance (opencode-spec-review, inline)

Checked `opencode-ts-declare-first` against core `spec/13-ts-declare-first.md`:
three ATOMIC phases in order (declare → RED tests → impl) ✓; three refusals
(collapsed commit / impl-in-declare / no-observed-RED) ✓; verification-gate
integration documented ✓; SHOULD-level, codex named in core CHANGELOG ✓;
frontmatter `implements_spec: 0.4.0`, `implements_gate: tdd` ✓. Verdict: PASS.

## Stage 2 — Independent code-quality review (opencode-code-review)

Independent reviewer (separate context) reviewed commits `8f24662` (P2) and
`21f3aab` (P4), running every claim (real jq, the official mermaid parser,
git check-ignore, install.sh --dry-run, the full harness).

- §13 fidelity: PASS — three phases + three refusals captured; 3 templates
  **byte-identical** to the claude-workflow reference; declare template is
  declare-only; test exercises the surface (RED); impl matches signatures.
- Migration 0002: PASS — additive (0.2.0→0.2.0); the escaped-apostrophe jq
  parses + applies + is idempotent; rollback exactly reverses; base tdd
  binding preserved.
- Drift: PASS — 31/0/1; stays green when 0003 lands at to_version 0.2.0.
- test_migration_0002: PASS — no false-pass; declare-only assertion genuinely
  detects an impl body; mktemp/trap RETURN correct.
- Binding consistency: PASS — Step 3 row == config-hooks == migration; valid JSON.
- .gitignore: PASS — setup-skill symlink still ignored, new skill's templates
  now tracked; no other skill affected.
- install.sh --dry-run: PASS — lists the skill, exits 0.

**Verdict: APPROVE** — no BLOCK/HIGH/MEDIUM.

### Non-blocking (left as-is)
- NIT: skill `version: 0.1.0` (skill-release axis) vs `implements_spec: 0.4.0`
  (spec-conformance axis) — distinct axes, consistent with the reference.
- LOW: `test_migration_0002`'s inline fixture `fires_when` omits the
  apostrophe, so it doesn't regression-test the `'\''` escape (the real
  escaped jq was separately verified working). Test-coverage nicety only.
