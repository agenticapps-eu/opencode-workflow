# Migration 0003 — Delegate §10 observability to agenticapps-observability

`agenticapps-workflow-core` §10 (observability) obliges every host to
provide a **generator** (§10.7). Per ADR-0004, opencode-workflow satisfies
§10 by **delegating** to the standalone, host-neutral
`agenticapps-observability` skill — the same way claude-workflow does
(its migration `0022`) — rather than re-owning a generator inside this
scaffolder. A delegation to a consumable skill is a *satisfied* MUST
under §09, not a spec delta; `full` conformance is preserved.

The opencode install surface is the obs repo's `install-codex.sh` (added in
agenticapps-observability v0.12.0), which symlinks the skill into
`${OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.config/opencode}/skills/observability`. This migration does
**not** auto-install it (mirroring claude-workflow D-03): it verifies the
skill is present and aborts with an actionable pointer if absent —
failing closed so a project is never left half-wired.

This migration is **additive** (`from 0.2.0 → 0.2.0`): it rides on the
0.2.0 / `implements_spec: 0.4.0` claim established by migration `0001`.
It does not move the version. The drift test stays green (latest
migration `0003` to_version 0.2.0 == trigger SKILL.md version 0.2.0).

Division of labour (mirrors claude-workflow):
- The **obs skill** owns observability — it scaffolds the host-neutral
  wrapper/middleware (`$observability init`) and validates + baselines
  (`$observability scan`, host-neutral; reads `AGENTS.md` on opencode).
- **This migration** records the delegation in the project's
  `.planning/config.json`, **relocates** the §10.8 `observability:` block
  that `init` emits into `CLAUDE.md` over to `AGENTS.md` (the canonical
  opencode file, preserving init's real content), and repoints a stale skill
  reference. Materialising the host's instruction-file block in the host
  migration mirrors claude-workflow (whose migrations own the CLAUDE.md
  block). The obs-init host-awareness (emitting `AGENTS.md` directly) is a
  tracked obs-repo follow-up; until it lands, this relocate closes §10.8
  on the opencode side.

## Pre-flight (hard aborts on failure)

```bash
# Project root must be a git repo
test -d .git || { echo "not a git repo — initialize first with: git init"; exit 1; }

# Project must already be at >= 0.2.0 (migrations 0001/0002 applied)
test -f .planning/config.json || { echo ".planning/config.json missing — run migrations 0000–0002 first"; exit 1; }
command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "jq required for this migration"; exit 1; }

# The 'observability' skill must be installed as a SEPARATE install (D-03 mirror).
# No auto-install — abort with an actionable pointer if absent.
OBS="${OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.config/opencode}/skills/observability/SKILL.md"
if [ ! -f "$OBS" ] || ! grep -q '^name: observability' "$OBS"; then
  echo "ABORT: the 'observability' skill is not installed for opencode."
  echo "Install agenticapps-observability separately, then re-run:"
  echo ""
  echo "  git clone https://github.com/agenticapps-eu/agenticapps-observability \\"
  echo "    \"\${OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR:-\$HOME/.config/opencode}/skills/agenticapps-observability\""
  echo "  bash \"\${OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR:-\$HOME/.config/opencode}/skills/agenticapps-observability/install-codex.sh\""
  echo ""
  echo "Then re-run \$update-opencode-agenticapps-workflow."
  exit 3
fi
```

Each abort exit-3 includes the remediation step. Pre-flight failures must
be resolved before the migration applies — it is not silently skipped.

## Steps

### Step 1: Record the §10 delegation in .planning/config.json

**Idempotency check:** `jq -e '.hooks.observability.delegated_to == "observability"' .planning/config.json >/dev/null`
**Pre-condition:** `.planning/config.json` is valid JSON with a `.hooks` object
**Apply:**
```bash
tmp="$(mktemp)"
jq '.hooks.observability = {
  "delegated_to": "observability",
  "implements_spec": "0.4.0",
  "host": "opencode",
  "invoke": "$observability",
  "init": "$observability init",
  "scan": "$observability scan",
  "spec_section": "10",
  "note": "§10 satisfied by delegation to the standalone agenticapps-observability skill (ADR-0004); install via install-codex.sh"
}' .planning/config.json > "$tmp" && mv "$tmp" .planning/config.json
```
**Rollback:**
```bash
tmp="$(mktemp)"
jq 'del(.hooks.observability)' .planning/config.json > "$tmp" && mv "$tmp" .planning/config.json
```

### Step 2: Materialise the §10.8 metadata block in AGENTS.md (relocate from CLAUDE.md)

On opencode the canonical instruction file is `AGENTS.md`, so the §10.8
`observability:` metadata block MUST live there (spec §10.8: "whichever
filename the host runtime treats as canonical"). The obs skill's
`$observability init` currently writes the block — wrapped in the
load-bearing anchors `<!-- agenticapps:observability:start -->` …
`<!-- agenticapps:observability:end -->` — into `CLAUDE.md` (its Phase 6 is
not yet host-aware). This step **relocates** that block to `AGENTS.md`,
preserving init's real, populated content (destinations / policy / spec_version)
rather than fabricating a placeholder. The host migration owning the host's
instruction-file block mirrors how claude-workflow's migrations own the
CLAUDE.md block.

**Idempotency check (positive — block already in the canonical file):**
`grep -q '^observability:' AGENTS.md`
**Pre-condition (there is a block to relocate):**
`test -f CLAUDE.md && grep -q '<!-- agenticapps:observability:start -->' CLAUDE.md`
(If neither AGENTS.md has the block nor CLAUDE.md has one to relocate,
observability has not been initialised — run `$observability init` first, then
re-run this migration. See Skip cases.)
**Apply:**
```bash
# Append the anchored observability block (init's real content) to AGENTS.md…
awk '/<!-- agenticapps:observability:start -->/,/<!-- agenticapps:observability:end -->/' CLAUDE.md >> AGENTS.md
# …and delete it from CLAUDE.md (between anchors, inclusive).
awk 'BEGIN{d=0}
     /<!-- agenticapps:observability:start -->/{d=1}
     d==0{print}
     /<!-- agenticapps:observability:end -->/{d=0}' CLAUDE.md > CLAUDE.md.0003.tmp \
  && mv CLAUDE.md.0003.tmp CLAUDE.md
```
**Rollback:** `git checkout AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` (or move the anchored block
back from AGENTS.md to CLAUDE.md).

### Step 3: Repoint a stale observability skill reference in AGENTS.md (conditional)

**Idempotency check (positive — repointed/absent):**
`! grep -qE '^[[:space:]]*skill:[[:space:]]*add-observability' AGENTS.md`
(Returns 0 when no stale `add-observability` skill reference remains — either
already repointed or never present.)
**Pre-condition:** `grep -q '^observability:' AGENTS.md` (there is a block to
repoint — true after Step 2 on a project that ran init).
**Apply:** in the `observability:` block's `skill:` line ONLY, rewrite a legacy
`add-observability` reference to `observability`. Do NOT rewrite historical
prose elsewhere. The substitution is anchored to a line-leading `skill:` key.
```bash
sed -i.0003.bak -E 's/^([[:space:]]*skill:[[:space:]]*)add-observability/\1observability/' AGENTS.md
rm -f AGENTS.md.0003.bak
```
**Rollback:** `git checkout AGENTS.md` (or reverse the substitution).

## Post-checks

- `jq -e '.hooks.observability.delegated_to == "observability"' .planning/config.json` — delegation recorded
- `jq . .planning/config.json >/dev/null` — config still valid JSON
- If observability is initialised: `grep -q '^observability:' AGENTS.md` — §10.8 block in the canonical opencode file
- If observability is initialised: `! grep -q '<!-- agenticapps:observability:start -->' CLAUDE.md` 2>/dev/null — block no longer duplicated in CLAUDE.md
- `! grep -qE '^[[:space:]]*skill:[[:space:]]*add-observability' AGENTS.md` — no stale skill ref
- `test -f "${OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.config/opencode}/skills/observability/SKILL.md"` — obs skill installed
- Drift test green: trigger SKILL.md `version` (0.2.0) == latest migration `to_version` (0.2.0)

## Skip cases

- **Already delegated** (Step 1 idempotency passes) — Step 1 no-ops.
- **`observability` skill absent** → pre-flight ABORTS (exit 3) with the
  separate-install pointer. NOT a silent skip and NOT an auto-install (D-03).
- **Observability not yet initialised** (no `observability:` block in AGENTS.md
  AND no anchored block in CLAUDE.md to relocate) → Steps 2 and 3 no-op; the
  delegation record (Step 1) still applies. Run `$observability init`, then
  re-run `$update-opencode-agenticapps-workflow` so Step 2 relocates the §10.8
  block into AGENTS.md. A project with no observability has no §10.8 obligation
  until it adds observability.
- **Block already in AGENTS.md** (Step 2 idempotency passes) — Step 2 no-ops;
  Step 3 repoints any stale skill ref.

## Notes

Testable non-interactively via `test_migration_0003` in
`migrations/run-tests.sh` (idempotency + jq apply/rollback on a synthetic
config; the §10.8 relocate on a synthetic CLAUDE.md→AGENTS.md; the conditional
repoint on a synthetic AGENTS.md). Per migration immutability the chain stays
contiguous (`0000`→`0001`→`0002`→`0003`); 0003 is not yet shipped (this branch
is unreleased), so refining it pre-merge is not an immutability violation.
