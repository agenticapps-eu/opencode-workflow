# materialise-core-artifacts-version: 1.0.0
#
# materialise-core-artifacts.sh — put the pinned core artifacts on disk at bin/,
# verified against tools/core-vendor.manifest.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# This host used to VENDOR core's change-gate and reviewer wrapper: real bytes,
# committed, re-vendored by hand on every core release (PRs #16 #17 #18 #19 #20
# #21 — six of them, each a mechanical diff nobody reads). They drifted, which
# is what copies do. On 2026-07-31 this repo still carried gate 1.3.1 against
# core's 2.0.0 and wrapper 1.1.0 against 1.2.0, and nothing noticed.
#
# ADR-0013 replaced the copies with a pin. But unlike claude-workflow, where
# deleting the copies outright was clean, this repo has several consumers that
# legitimately want the artifacts at a stable repo-local path:
#
#   - migrations/0011-bind-openspec-v1.md is a SHIPPED migration that installs a
#     target project's copies with `install -m 0755 bin/openspec-change-gate.sh`
#     and `bin/reviewer-cli.sh`. Deleting the files would make an already-shipped
#     migration fail mid-replay on a missing file.
#   - skills/opencode-openspec-change-review/SKILL.md documents `bin/reviewer-cli.sh`
#     as the fallback when ~/.agenticapps/bin/reviewer-cli.sh is not installed.
#   - .github/workflows/openspec-gate.yml scores both, then runs the gate.
#   - .github/workflows/ci.yml `bash -n`s both.
#   - migrations/run-tests.sh asserts both exist and drives the gate through its
#     exit-code truth table.
#
# So bin/ stays — as a CACHE, not as source. The bytes are gitignored and
# regenerated from the pin, so they cannot drift: a wrong byte fails the
# resolver's sha256 check and nothing lands.
#
# Idempotent. Re-running with the artifacts already correct is a no-op, which is
# what makes it cheap enough to call from install.sh, CI and the test suite.
#
# USAGE
#   materialise-core-artifacts.sh [--check]
#
#     --check   verify only; do not write. Non-zero if anything is missing or
#               does not match the pin.
#
# ENV
#   CORE_CHECKOUT   explicit path to a core working copy; tried first.
#   CORE_OFFLINE=1  never reach the network; fail if no local source resolves.
#
# EXIT
#   0  every artifact is present and matches the pin
#   1  could not resolve, or --check found a mismatch
